    Version: 2.1.0 - Production Ready
    
    Turn on lights when motion, occupancy or presence is detected if it's night time, based on sunset/sunrise (with offsets) for your location.
    Includes fail-safes for sensor disconnections, handles the "already in the room when it gets dark" edge case, and supports a Manual Override (Bypass) switch.
